## Introduction

Form validation is an essential part of web development, ensuring that users provide valid and complete data when submitting forms on a website. In this project, we explore how to perform basic form validation using HTML and JavaScript. We cover topics such as password strength validation, email format validation, dynamic form field generation, and form submission handling with validation.

## Features

This project includes several form validation tasks:

1. **Password Strength Validation**: Validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria, such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric digits, and special characters.

2. **Email Format Validation**: Ensures that the entered email address follows the standard email format, including an alphanumeric username, the "@" symbol, and the domain name.

3. **Dynamic Form Field Generation**: Dynamically generates a variable number of text input fields based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu. It validates that all generated fields are filled before submission.

4. **Form Submission Handling**: Handles form submission and performs validation before submission. Checks if all required fields are filled and displays appropriate error messages.
