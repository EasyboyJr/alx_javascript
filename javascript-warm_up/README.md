# JavaScript Warm-Up

## Introduction
This README provides a quick warm-up guide to JavaScript, covering essential concepts and coding exercises to get you started.

## Basics of JavaScript

### Variables
JavaScript variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

```
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);
```

## Data Types
JavaScript has various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and more. Understanding data types is crucial.

```
let number = 42;
let text = "JavaScript";
let isTrue = true;
```

## Operators
JavaScript offers arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators for manipulating data.

```
let x = 5;
let y = 3;
let sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);
```

## Control Structures
Control structures like if, else, for, while, and switch help control the flow of your code.

```
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You can vote!");
} else {
    console.log("You're too young to vote.");
}
```

## Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code. Learn how to define and call functions in JavaScript.

```
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
sayHello();
```

## Parameters and Arguments
Functions can accept parameters, allowing you to pass data for processing.

```
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("Alice");
```

## Return Statements
Understand how return statements work in functions and what they return.

```
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
let result = add(3, 5);
console.log(result);
```

## Arrays and Objects
### Arrays
Arrays are ordered lists of values. Explore how to create, manipulate, and iterate through arrays.

```
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]);
```

### Objects
Objects store key-value pairs. Learn how to work with objects and access their properties.

```
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
};
console.log(person.name);
```

## Coding Exercises

To practice what you've learned, try the following JavaScript coding exercises:

1. Create a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.
1. Write a function that finds the largest number in an array.
1. Implement a function that reverses a given string.
1. Create a program that checks if a number is prime.
1. Build a simple to-do list application in the console.

Feel free to practice, explore, and experiment with JavaScript. Happy coding!
