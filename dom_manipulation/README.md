# JavaScript HTML DOM Manipulation

This project focuses on JavaScript's interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM). You'll learn how to access and manipulate HTML elements, use CSS selectors, traverse the DOM tree, and work with event listeners and handlers.

## Task 0: Play with the DOM

In this task, you'll write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the basics of interacting with the DOM. You'll access and modify an HTML element by its ID.

**Instructions:**

- Use the provided HTML template.
- Select the `<p>` element using its ID and store it in a variable.
- Use the DOM API to modify the content of the `<p>` element.
- Verify that the program successfully updates the element content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

## Task 1: Selecting HTML Elements Using Selectors

Task 1 demonstrates the use of selectors to select specific HTML elements. You'll use `document.querySelectorAll` to target elements with specific classes and modify their formatting.

**Instructions:**

- Use the provided HTML template.
- Select the `<p>` element with the class "highlight" using `document.querySelectorAll`.
- Modify the formatting of the selected element to make its content boldened.
- Verify that the program successfully modifies the element's content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

## Task 2: Modifying Element Content, Attributes, and Styles

In this task, you'll write a JavaScript program that selects an `<img>` element by its ID and modifies its content, attributes, and styles.

**Instructions:**

- Use the provided HTML template.
- Select the `<img>` element using its ID and store it in a variable.
- Use the DOM API to modify the following:
  - Change the `src` attribute to "https://picsum.photos/200/301".
  - Update the `alt` attribute to "New image".
  - Change the border style to "2px solid red".
- Verify that the program successfully updates the element's content and style when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

## Task 3: Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements

Task 3 focuses on creating, appending, and removing elements using the DOM. You'll create a new `<p>` element, append it to a container, and implement a button to toggle its visibility.

**Instructions:**

- Use the provided HTML template.
- Select the container element using its ID and store it in a variable.
- Use the DOM API to create a new `<p>` element with the content "New paragraph."
- Append the newly created elements to the container element.
- Add a button that toggles the visibility of the newly created paragraph.
- Verify that the program successfully creates, appends, and toggles elements when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

## Getting Started

- Clone the project repository.
- Open the HTML files for each task in a web browser to see the results of your JavaScript code.

## Prerequisites

A web browser to view and test the HTML files.
