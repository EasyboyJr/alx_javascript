## What is JavaScript Networking?
JavaScript networking refers to the process of establishing and managing network connections using JavaScript, primarily for web-based applications. It enables communication between your client-side code and remote servers or APIs, allowing data exchange, resource retrieval, and more.

## HTTP Requests
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the web. JavaScript leverages HTTP to send and receive data over networks. Understanding HTTP methods and status codes is essential for effective networking.

## Working with APIs
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow your JavaScript applications to interact with external services, databases, and systems. Learn how to work with APIs to access valuable data and functionality.

## Making GET Requests
GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server or API. Explore how to create and send GET requests, handle responses, and parse data for your applications.

## Making POST Requests
POST requests are used to send data to a server or API. Discover how to make POST requests to create or update resources on the server, and explore various data formats.

## Handling Responses
Effectively handling responses from server requests is crucial. Learn about asynchronous programming, callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage data returned by network operations.

## Advanced Networking
Dive deeper into advanced networking concepts like authentication, error handling, rate limiting, and security best practices for secure and robust applications.

## Troubleshooting
Debugging and troubleshooting network-related issues is part of the development process. Explore common problems and solutions when working with JavaScript networking.

## Resources
Find additional resources, including libraries, frameworks, documentation, and tutorials, to enhance your understanding of JavaScript networking.
