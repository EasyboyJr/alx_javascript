# Cookies & Local Storage JavaScript Project

This JavaScript project focuses on creating, manipulating, and working with cookies and browser web storage (local storage and session storage). The project consists of several tasks, each building upon the previous one to demonstrate various aspects of using cookies and web storage in JavaScript.

## Table of Contents

1. Task 0: Create Basic Cookie
2. Task 1: Create Cookie with Expiration Date and Specific Path
3. Task 2: Read Cookie
4. Task 3: Delete Cookie and Mini Application
5. Task 4: Use js-cookie
6. Task 5: Local Storage
7. Task 6: Session Storage
8. Task 7: Advanced Use of Web Storage

### Task 0: Create Basic Cookie

In this task, you'll create a basic HTML page that allows users to set cookies with the "firstname" and "email" values. You'll also implement functionality to display the set cookies.

### Task 1: Create Cookie with Expiration Date and Specific Path

Task 1 builds upon Task 0 by modifying the way cookies are set to expire in 10 days. This task focuses on setting specific settings for the cookies.

### Task 2: Read Cookie

Task 2 involves creating a function to read cookies by name. You'll also update the display of cookies to show "Email: EMAIL - Firstname: FIRSTNAME".

### Task 3: Delete Cookie and Mini Application

In this task, you'll create a mini application for user login. It includes showing and hiding a login form, deleting cookies, and showing a welcome message when a user is logged in.

### Task 4: Use js-cookie

Task 4 introduces the use of the "js-cookie" library to simplify cookie manipulation. You'll replace vanilla JavaScript functions with "js-cookie" functions for cookie operations.

### Task 5: Local Storage

Task 5 involves building a basic shopping cart application using local storage. Users can view available products and add them to their cart. The cart's state is maintained using local storage.

### Task 6: Session Storage

Task 6 is similar to Task 5 but uses session storage instead of local storage. The shopping cart's state is now limited to the session's lifetime.

### Task 7: Advanced Use of Web Storage

In Task 7, you'll build an advanced shopping cart application using session storage. It includes adding and removing items from the cart, clearing the entire cart, and displaying the cart's content. This task demonstrates more complex interactions with web storage.


## Notes

- Ensure that your browser supports web storage (local storage and session storage) for tasks involving storage.
- This project focuses on hands-on experience with cookies and web storage in JavaScript, covering a range of functionalities and scenarios.
